Hi there. I'm Anjith Sasindran. An android and web developer living and working in Bangalore.
I love programming, gaming, reading about computers and I'm a bit of a gadget freak. I also
can type pretty fast ðŸ¤·. I'm currently developing 225Fit and was previously at Grab and 
before BookMyShow. I play and watch football, enjoys working out and often times read books.

I would like to keep most of my blog posts simple and short and straight to the point. So why
write a blog?

- I sometimes have ideas which I would like to jot down somewhere
- I might have worked on some interesting projects which I would like to share
- Or I would like to share my general views on some specific topics (mostly programming related)
